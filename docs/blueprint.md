## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated pink (#D81B60) to reflect the fashion and style focus, yet avoid the existing styling which uses semi-transparent gradients.
- Background color: Light pink (#F9E4E9), a desaturated shade of the primary to complement a light color scheme.
- Accent color: Purple (#9C27B0) used sparingly for interactive elements to provide contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a clean, modern, and readable design.
- Use consistent and simple icons from a library like Font Awesome or Material Icons, colored in the accent color.
- Maintain a clean and responsive grid layout, using Tailwind CSS grid classes to adapt to different screen sizes.
- Use subtle CSS transitions and animations for hover effects and loading states to enhance the user experience.
